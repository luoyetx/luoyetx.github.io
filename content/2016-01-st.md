Many face alignment algorithm need to perform a similarity transform between training shapes and a particular shape, which is always a mean shape over ground truth shapes. During the trainin status, the algorithm will do a similarity transform between target shape residual and mean shape. This is required to calculate the transform parameters between two shapes.

When implementing the algorithm of 3000fps, I didn't really understand the math forumlas underneath. Today, I spend some time to study the math and find that [Procrustes analysis][ps] make things work.

Let me describe the problem here. We need to perform a similarity transform such that $S_2 = cR(S_1)+t$. $S_2$ presents Shape2 and $S_1$ presents Shape1, $c$ is the scale ratio and $t$ is the bias, the most important term is $R$ which presents the rotation.

$$
R =
\begin{bmatrix}
cos\theta \quad -sin\theta \\
sin\theta \quad cos\theta \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

We first need to normalize the Shape, which can minus the mean point of a Shape and divided by the scale. The mean point can be easily calculated but the scale is pretty not intuitive. Actually, we can use $|S|$ or $|S|^2$ as Shape scale, according to Procrustes analysis, it matters little. After this step, we get bias $t$ and scale ratio $c$, what's left is all about $R$.

$R$ is a rotation matrix and we have many points to rotate. The target is to rotate the normalized Shape1 $S_1$ to normailzed Shape2 $S_2$, which will give us a minimum error between rotated normalized $S_1$ and normalized $S_2$. We can write a formula to present this. $[x_1, y_1, ...]$ presents the normalized $S_1$ and $[u_1, v_1, ...]$ presents the normalized $S_2$.

$$
R=
\begin{bmatrix}
a \quad -b \\
b \quad a \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

$$
E=\sum_{i}{||
\begin{bmatrix}
a \quad -b \\
b \quad a \\
\end{bmatrix} \cdot
\begin{bmatrix}
x_i \\
y_i \\
\end{bmatrix} -
\begin{bmatrix}
u_i \\
v_i \\
\end{bmatrix}
||^2}
$$

In order to minimize $E$, we can use [least squares][ls] method to calculate parameter $a$ and $b$. Take the derivatives and make them all zeros will give us the answer.

$$
\frac{\partial E}{\partial a}=\sum_{i}{2x_i(ax_i-by_i-u_i)+2y_i(bx_i+ay_i-v_i)}=0
$$

$$
\frac{\partial E}{\partial b}=\sum_{i}{-2y_i(ax_i-by_i-u_i)+2x_i(bx_i+ay_i-v_i)}=0
$$

Solving the equations above will give us $a$ and $b$.

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
a \\
b \\
\end{bmatrix}=\frac{1}{\sum{x_i^2+y_i^2}}
\begin{bmatrix}
\sum{x_iu_i+y_iv_i} \\
\sum{x_iv_i-y_iu_i} \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

$$
tan\theta=\frac{b}{a}=\frac{\sum{x_iv_i-y_iu_i}}{\sum{x_iu_i+y_iv_i}}
$$

With $tan\theta$, we can get $R$.
